# Groq Gmail Assistant: AI-Powered Email Management

The Groq Gmail Assistant is an AI-driven tool that helps manage your Gmail account by automatically reading and responding to emails. It utilizes natural language processing, sentiment analysis, and custom AI models to understand email content and generate human-like responses. With features like automated email processing, AI-driven responses, appointment creation, web search integration, and note-taking capabilities, the Groq Gmail Assistant streamlines your email management workflow.

## How Chaos Works: A Step-by-Step Process

1. **Email Fetching**: Chaos connects to your Gmail account using IMAP and fetches new, unread emails.

2. **Email Parsing**: The fetched emails are parsed to extract relevant information, such as the sender, subject, and body content.

3. **Text Preprocessing**: The email body undergoes text preprocessing techniques, including removing stop words, tokenization, and cleaning up HTML content.

4. **Sentiment Analysis**: Advanced sentiment analysis models are applied to the preprocessed email content to determine the overall sentiment and tone of the email.

5. **Relevance Determination**: Chaos analyzes the email content to determine if a response is required based on predefined criteria and the results of the sentiment analysis.

6. **Response Generation**: If a response is deemed necessary, Chaos uses the LangChain Ollama-based AI to generate a contextually relevant response by considering the email content, sentiment, and any relevant notes or web search results.

7. **Tool Utilization**: Chaos can leverage various tools to enhance the response generation process, such as creating calendar appointments, performing web searches, writing notes, or reading previously saved notes.

8. **Response Refinement**: The generated response is further refined and optimized using the Groq-based AI to ensure coherence, clarity, and appropriateness.

9. **Email Sending**: The final response is sent back to the original sender using SMTP, effectively automating the email reply process.

10. **Logging and Monitoring**: Throughout the process, Chaos logs important events and actions for monitoring and debugging purposes.

By automating this end-to-end email management process, Chaos saves you time and effort while providing timely and relevant responses to your emails.
